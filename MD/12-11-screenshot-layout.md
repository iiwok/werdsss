# Screenshot Layout and Navigation Fix - December 11, 2023

## Issue Description
The application needed a clean screenshot layout for social media sharing, but faced several challenges:
1. Navigation and Buy Me Coffee button appearing in screenshots
2. Font loading issues in the screenshot route
3. Hydration errors from client/server mismatches

## Technical Details

### Affected Files
- app/word/screenshot/layout.tsx
- app/layout.tsx
- components/Navigation.tsx
- components/NavDropdown.tsx

### Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Separate Screenshot Layout
```typescript
// app/word/screenshot/layout.tsx
export default function ScreenshotLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <div className={`${handwriting.variable}`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### 2. Conditional Navigation Component
```typescript:MD/12-11-screenshot-layout.md
// components/Navigation.tsx
export default function Navigation() {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  const isScreenshotPath = pathname?.includes('/word/screenshot')

  if (isScreenshotPath) return null

  return (
    <>
      <UnderlineNavigation />
      <BuyMeCoffeeButton />
    </>
  )
}
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Layout Conflicts
- Root layout and screenshot layout both trying to handle HTML structure
- Font loading duplicated across layouts
- Client/server hydration mismatches

### 2. Navigation Visibility
- Navigation components needed path-aware rendering
- Buy Me Coffee button appearing in screenshots

## Implementation Fix

1. Created a minimal screenshot layout that inherits from root
2. Moved navigation conditional rendering to client component
3. Maintained font loading through variable inheritance

## Testing and Validation
1. Verified clean screenshots without navigation
2. Confirmed font loading in screenshot route
3. Tested navigation visibility in main routes
4. Validated hydration stability

## Lessons Learned
1. **Next.js Layouts:**
   - Keep nested layouts minimal
   - Inherit styles from root when possible
   - Handle client/server carefully

2. **Component Organization:**
   - Use client components for path-based logic
   - Keep server components pure
   - Separate concerns between layouts

3. **Font Management:**
   - Load fonts at highest needed level
   - Pass font variables through className
   - Avoid duplicate font loading

## Future Improvements
1. Consider automated screenshot testing
2. Add loading states for screenshot generation
3. Implement error boundaries for layout issues
4. Document layout hierarchy
